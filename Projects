As an ambitious person, I have so many interests.
I'm interested to know more about finance, Malaysia economics, business operations, unique ideas from contemporary books, cinematography, pyschology, foods. 
Data is used in all areas of our lives. Hence, I aim to leverage data to study everything I'm interested at. It's not that I want to know everything, but I want to improve my skills in leveraging data in many areas.
