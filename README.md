# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Nurul Iman Farhanah. I am 24 years old this year. 

I graduated in Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology at Universiti Malaya with CGPA of 3.72. However, I no longer looking to pursue a career in this field although I really enjoyed studying it back then.

Right now, I'm learning on how to build a portfolio because I want to get experience to work as Data Analyst. Over the past 3 months, I have learned SQL, advanced Excel, basic Power BI, and basic Python. Clearly, there is so much more to learn yet!

My goals for March 2025?
1. Build portfolio using GitHub/Kaggle
  - Web scraping
2. Practice coding daily on LeetCode/HackerRank
3. Khatam al-Quran
4. Apply Master's as backup plan if I don't get a job (I want to get a job)
5. Finish Google Business Intelligence track
6. Continue learn new stuffs on DataCamp
7. Practice IV/language proficiency

Let's gooooo
